The RIASEC object contains values based on the RIASEC model. These numeric values typically range from 0 to 10, representing extremes; values outside this range are rare and indicate very extreme tendencies. Use these RIASEC values to determine the user's work personality and consider them when suggesting career paths. The Preferences object provides details about the user's preferences for their dream career. It includes the user's personality type, preferred work environment, job priorities, education level, and career goals. The personality type describes the userâ€™s overarching traits, while the work environment highlights their ideal workplace conditions. The job priority array outlines what the user values most in their career. The education level specifies their degree type, and career goals describe the role the user aspires to achieve in their career. The WorkStyle object details the user's working preferences. StructurePreference indicates whether they prefer a structured, hierarchical career or a more flexible one. Collaboration reveals if they prefer teamwork or working individually. WorkEnvironment shows whether they thrive in a fast-paced and dynamic environment or prefer a stable and predictable setting.`
